# PTZ

This code is inspired by CSerial - A C++ Class for Serial Communications
https://www.codeguru.com/cpp/i-n/network/serialcommunications/article.php/c2503/CSerial--A-C-Class-for-Serial-Communications.htm

and then serial.cpp was tailored for vedio camera control
PTZ.cpp is just interactive main function to test serial.cpp,
you can use your own code to use function in serial.h to control the vedio camera

Developed in Visual Studio 2017
