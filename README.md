# Pan Tilt Zoom Control Interface for Video Camera

[!alt](/demo_images/EVI-D70.jpeg)

The project was developed in Visual Studio 2017
For serial communications part, I use [CSerial](https://www.codeguru.com/cpp/i-n/network/serialcommunications/article.php/c2503/CSerial--A-C-Class-for-Serial-Communications.htm)



and then serial.cpp was tailored for vedio camera control

PTZ.cpp is just a demo usage to test serial.cpp,
you can use your own code to use function in serial.h to control the vedio camera
